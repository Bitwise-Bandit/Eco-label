# About
Eco-Label is an open-source platform that helps users understand what’s really in their food. It removes all filters and tells the objective truth about the popular food products and their ingredients. By combining barcode scanning and a crowdsourced additives database, Eco-Label makes chemical safety data accessible and transparent. Its food safety metrics aren't baseless claims of a corp but the ones backed by research and approved by WHO.
